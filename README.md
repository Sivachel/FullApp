# FullApp
full stack application with Sinatra @Sparta Global

## Homework
Create a full stack application with Sinatra on a new resource. This could be Cars, Recipes, Book etc. This is a repeat of our work in class over the last few days. You must use Postgres to store your information and the app should be styled nicely to make use of the static assets - https://medium.com/@kerenlerner/how-to-include-images-css-and-or-javascript-in-your-sinatra-web-application-45e2ebbfa75f. Try and include as much of what we have done up to know at the academy. Don't forget Git and the Definition of Done. Maybe you can have a look at including some JS.
